        <h1> My Sewing Hobbie </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
    <p> My name is Feba Joseph and I love sewing. Sewing is one of the types of arts and crafts I do and I have been able to create lots of different plushies such as an owl, elphant, monkey and a rabbit with her baby. It is very enjoyable and also can be done as a pastime. It is also a skill for life and is taught in schools too. Sewing is a wonder of its own! </p>
